# Statistical Computing (I decided to drop the course after the first session; I have worked on all topics in the past)

Statistics is the study of variation in output.

## Monte Carlo methods:
One form of Monte Carlo methods: P(event) = (number of times the simulated event is favorable) / (total number of trials)

## Resampling methods:
- We have only one sample. We cannot sample again from the population.
- Sampling repeatedly from the sample that's available - resampling.

## Optimization:
- Linear regression: least square
- Maximum likelihood estimation

## Prescribed Text:
Statistical computing with R


## Note:
I will be reading the book even though I dropped the course. I will try to update the notes here.
