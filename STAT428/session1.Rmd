# Session 1

Statistics is the study of variation in output.

Monte Carlo methods:
One form of Monte Carlo methods: P(event) = (number of times the simulated event is favorable) / (total number of trials)

Resampling methods:
- We have only one sample. We cannot sample again from the population.
- Sampling repeatedly from the sample that's available - resampling.

Optimization:
- Linear regression: least square
- Maximum likelihood estimation
