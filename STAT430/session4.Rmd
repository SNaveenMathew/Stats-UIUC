# Session 4:

0 is starting time point, 1 is end time point of the feature window

Overlap between (t_i,0, t_i,1) and (t_j,0, t_j,1) => y_i not IID. We can skip bars that have overlap by postponing the bars. This leads to loss of information.

# Concurrent at time t

At least one common return between y_i and y_j. How many y_i and y_j cross (t-1, t).

Number of concurrent labels can be counted for a particular (t-1, t)

This leads to a matrix with T (tick bars) rows and i columns. i_max = I = number of feature bars

Concurrence at time t can be calculated using c_t = \sum_{i=1}^{I}{1_{t,i}} -> rowsum of the matrix

Uniqueness of label i at time t: u_{t,i} = 1_{t,i}/c_t -> colsum of the matrix.

Average uniqueness of label i: Average of uniqueness over all t. Higher uniqueness => lower degree of overlap between that label and other labels

For time series data the overlap will be very large => very small uniqueness (see histogram)

## Bagging:

Sample with replacement => 2/3 unique levels, some will overlap

If K < I non-overlapping features => as we sample K times, we will have very few unique labels

## Sequential bootstrap
\delta_j is average probability of sampling from label j

Steps:

If label 2 is selected, calculate uniqueness of label 2 with label 1, label 2, ..., label I. It is uniqueness of 2nd label given that 2nd label is already sampled

Since we are doing resampling with replacement, we may end up sampling (with) a vector of labels in 1 iteration. So some labels can be sampled more number of times than the number of iterations

Improves uniqueness of samples
