# Session 5

## K-means

```{r}
data("iris")
library(ggplot2)
set.seed(1)
model <- kmeans(x = iris[, 1:4], centers = 3, nstart = 10000)
plot(iris[, c(1,3)], col = model$cluster, pch = 20)
table(model$cluster, iris$Species)
```

### Issues with k-means:

#### Variable selection:
```{r}
model <- kmeans(x = iris[, 3:4], centers = 3, nstart = 10000)
plot(iris[, c(3,4)], col = model$cluster, pch = 20)
table(model$cluster, iris$Species)
```

Previous model was built using all the variables, yet it performs worse than k-means with just 2 variables.

#### Choosing k:

If research question is clear, we can define the number of clusters before running k-means

Otherwise: Plot #clusters vs tot.withinss and choose the "elbow" point

```{r}
wss <- c()
for(k in 2:10) {
  model <- kmeans(x = iris[, 3:4], centers = k, nstart = 10000)
  wss <- c(wss, model$tot.withinss)
}

plot(2:10, wss, type = 'l')
```
