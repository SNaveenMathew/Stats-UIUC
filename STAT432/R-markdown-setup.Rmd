# Question 1

We perform a linear model as asked in the assignment. 

```{r}
set.seed(1)
x = rnorm(100)
y = 0.5*x + 1 + rnorm(100)
lm(y ~ x)
```

The coefficients are $\beta_0 = 0.9623$ and $\beta_1 = 0.4989$.

# Question 2

To visualize the data, we use the following plot:

```{r fig.width=4.5, fig.height=4.5}
plot(y ~ x, xlab = "Input", ylab = "Output", main = "A simple plot", pch = 19)
```
