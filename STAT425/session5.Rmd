# Session 5

## Full model

```{r}
library(faraway)
data("savings")
print(head(savings))
full_model <- lm(sr ~ ., data = savings)
print(summary(full_model))
```

F-statistic DOF: p, n-p'

## Reduced model
```{r}
r_model1 <- lm(sr ~ dpi + ddpi, data = savings)
print(summary(r_model1))
```

dpi seems to be significant now at \(\alpha = 0.1\), whereas it was insignificant in the full model

## Model selection

```{r}
print(anova(r_model1, full_model))
```

The F-test p-value is less than \(\alpha\). This suggests that the full model is required

## F-stat extension

F-stat of regression is equivalent to testing \(\pmb{\beta} = \pmb{0}\)

```{r}
null_model <- lm(sr ~ 1, data = savings)
print(anova(null_model, r_model1))
print(summary(r_model1))
```

F = t^2
```{r}
model2 <- lm(sr ~ ddpi, data = savings)
summary(model2)
```

Observe that \(F-stat = {t-stat_{ddpi}}^2\)

```{r}

```
