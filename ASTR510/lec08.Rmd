## 

Missed some part of the lecture

## Boundary condition

Handles using "ghost zones". Eg: do a one sided difference

Special cases:

- Periodic boundaries: $\bar q_i = \bar q_{i+N}; i \in \{1, 2, ..., N-1\}$
- Subsonic outflow boundaries: characteristic flow decomposition: (v - s), v, (v + s), where s is the speed of sound and v is the speed of flow
- Boundary continuity and differentiability condition may lead to artificial mass inflow rate. Set values to corresponding inflowing solution
