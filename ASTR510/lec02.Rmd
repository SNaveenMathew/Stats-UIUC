## Why do parallel programs not always scale?

Embarassingly parallel: A process that can execute without dependencies on data or outputs from other processes. Therefore, there is no need for transfer between processors.

- Communication: Number of communication partners (worst case: all to all communication where all cores should communicate with every other core); Latency, bandwidth, other costs.
- Dependency: control or data dependency (eg: computed sum sequentially sent from core to core to compute sum of all elements)
- Load imbalance: synchronization, starvation (work starved processors will be the bottleneck)

Ideal case: each processor has the same amount of work to do: embarrassingly parallel

Makefile has a list of dependencies and commands
