# Paper 1

## Data

Supernova photometric classification challenge. 21319 simulated light curves from SPCC. Instantaneous inputs for RNN: time, flux, flux error, position, dust extinction, photo-z.

## Result

Type 1A vs not type 1A gives better result that other efforts.

# Paper 2

## Data

Simulated phase curves

## Method

Bidirectional recurrent encodings fed into random forest
