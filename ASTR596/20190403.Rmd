# Redshift:

- Relative motion of objects
- Expansion of universe
- massive objects causing increase in wavelength of light

# Estimation

Take spectra at different times

- Limited time in telescopes an spectroscopes
- Matching SED (spectral energy density) templates

Magnitudes of u, g, r, i, z as input. Output is photometric redshift. Colors are more important (determine shape) in determining the photometric redshift.

Uses 68%ile width of bias for nearest neighbors with similar photometric properties as uncertainty of estimated redshift.

# Paper 2

CNN vs boosted decision trees
