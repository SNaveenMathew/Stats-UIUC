# Background

Light follows geodesigcs (shortest path in space-time), which is not necessarily a straight line


# Convergence and shear

Traces mass surface density, gives isotropic magnification. Measured from galaxy flux $= \int \Delta\phi dz = \int4\pi G\rho dz = \frac{\Sigma}{\Sigma_C}$ 

Shear gives distortions

# Naive measurement

Complicated formula for $\sigma_8 = \int \frac{4\pi k^2dk}{(2\pi)^3}P(k)|W_8(k)|^2

# Beyond power spectrum

Different wavenumbers evolve at different rates => non-linearity. Smaller structures form clusters at faster rate than larger structures. Different CMB images with different concentrations of wavenumbers will have same power spectrum. Therefore, deep learning is useful. Alternatives: Minkowski diagram.

# Data

Dark matter N-body simulations + ray tracing for lensing

- 96 combinations of $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$

# Results

- Less scatter and bias
