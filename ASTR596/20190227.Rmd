# HiTS

HiTS takes difference of image and reference image (without transient). Positive examples are simulated using psf moved across the image.

RF seems to outperform CNN in certain signal-noise-ratios (SNR), but CNN generally has higher accruacy, precision, recall and F1 than RF

# Zwicky

Real/bogus classifier using ExtraTrees.

## Labelling

- Data in Zooniverse is labelled manually. Reference, difference, direction of difference and other meta data are provided to labellers.
- GROWTH marshall also gives a filtered list of candidate transients. But this is expected to be biased.
