Early time - Cosmological perturbation theory (CMB) - linear regime
Late time - non-linear N-Body simulation

Lambda CDM model - standard model of cosmology

# Missing satellite problem:

sub-halos in (CDM - cold dark matter) simulation not found in observations

- Strong lensing characterized by Einstein ring
- Thin lens approximation used based on distance between distant star - lensing object - light receiver

# Identification of gravitational lensing

- Flux ratio anomalies
- Gravitational imaging (focus of this seminar)
