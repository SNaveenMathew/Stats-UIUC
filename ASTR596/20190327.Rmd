# QSO:

Aperiodic, red noise

# LSST

- Good signal to noise
- Sufficient sampling (cadence)
- Low systematics - same instrument in good conditions

# Previous work

- Pan STARRS1

- Time scale and amplitude are more varied for quasars than for variable stars

# Light curve image

Each wavelength is treated as a separate image.

- CNN architecture averages across 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 days.
- Average 2 consecutive nights with zero padding.
- Color and temporal data are convolved separately.

# Results

- Bright quasars are difficult to detect because usually catalog has dim quasars.
- Recall independent of redshift.
- Can identify redshift better than KNN, but requires sufficient sample to train on.
