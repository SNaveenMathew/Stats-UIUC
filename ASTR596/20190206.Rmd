Metallicity is estimated using spectral lines

Traditional method: spectral energy distribution. But very complicated.

Features: 5 SDSS bands (u,g,r,i,z), stellar mass, photometric redshift, 10 independent colors, 10 independent squared colors.

2 samples: redshift 0.09-0.12, 0.12-0.25

Stellar mass and photometric redshift are less significant. Feature importance varies by redshift, but few features turn out to be important for multiple redshifts.

Dataset for CNN: 38" x 38" (arcsec) or 128 x 128 pxl.
